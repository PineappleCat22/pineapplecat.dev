                <p>over the years ive worked with a lot of server hardware which isnt as cool until you consider that i was doing so out of highschool so it was a pretty rare opportunity for me. I had a cool teacher and was able to pick up some Cisco Networking Academy certifications in IT and networking.</p>

                <p>This amalgam of technology on top of being my main server (running plex, fail2ban, hosting my webserver, pihole, data storage, vpn server, temporary security camera, etc.) at one point also served to remotely boot up my main tower pc. It's got a relay HAT on it and is duct taped to a 5 port netgear switch and a 2tb usb hard drive that it can barely power. It would boot my pc by switching a relay on with some very simple python code. Nowadays the main pc is with me in college (I never reinstalled the power button).</p>

        <h3>Cybersecurity News</h3>
        <h4>April 11th, 2024</h4>
        <h4>$10 million ransom against Hoya</h4>
        <p>Hoya, a firm that makes optical instruments and medical equipment, has disclosed a cyberattack affecting their production and orders. The group responsible, Hunters International, says they have 2 TB of stolen data, and are asking for $10 million in order to not release them. This could be juicy.</p>
        <h4>Apple warning countries of cyberattacks</h4>
        <p>Apple has reached out to users in more than 150 countries that have been targeted in a wide series of cyberattacks. They've pointed the finger at NSO group, a company that makes "mercenary spyware". Basically lockbit with an LLC</p>
        <h4>Deepfake calls are real and they are coming for you</h4>
        <p>ok maybe not you specifically. LastPass has revealed that hackers have targeted their employees with deepfake phone calls from the CEO. The attack failed, but this shows the capability of AI deepfakes in hacking, and that poorly trained employees may be at risk.</p>
        <h4>April 10th, 2024</h4>
        <p>we're so back</p>
        <h4>First native spectre v2 exploit against linux kernel</h4>
        <p>Researchers have discovered what they call the first native spectre v2 exploit against the linux kernel on intel systems. They call it Native Branch History Injection, and it can leak kernel memory at 3.5kB per second. Its probably intel's fault.</p>
        <h4>AT&T says 51 million compromised in data breach</h4>
        <p>AT&T has a cool new breach, or maybe it was the old one. They are sending notifications to 51 million customers warning them about the breach. They have not disclosed how the data was obtained. Hope i dont get an email.</p>
        <h4>My notes on XZ exploit</h4>
        <p>also while i was gone a major incident happened where someone tried to implement a backdoor in a library which would expose all debian and rpm systems. it was discovered by a microsoft dev who had noticed his ssh was taking 500 ms longer. the malicious party in question had a full plan on hacking the entire internet. its thwarted now, theres nothing to worry about.</p>
        <h4>March 20th, 2024</h4>
        <p>i am very sick</p>
        <h4>Cool new DoS method check it out now!</h4>
        <p>The CISPA Helmholtz-Center for Information Security devised a cool new attack known as "Loop DoS", which works pretty much like you'd expect. It utilizes a vulnerability in the UDP protocol (CVE-2024-2169) making it susceptible to IP spoofing. This allows an attacked to send a single message to start a communication loop, which can cause outages.</p>
        <h4>Data thief, extortionist, pleads guilty</h4>
        <p>Robert Purbeck, a data thief responsible for stealing the data of 132,000 people, and doing some very nasty healthcare data extorion. Recently he plead guilty to attacking 18 different institutions. He will be paying $1 million to victims. But thats like, seven bucks.</p>
        <h4>March 19th, 2024</h4>
        <h4>EPA and White House warn of water system hackers</h4>

        <h4>CRITICAL: Apex Legends RCE</h4>
        <p>Today a Remote Code Execution attack has been proven real in Apex Legends. The hackers appear to be attempting to interfere with a tournament or something. Either way, RCEs are bad dont play it until its fixed.</p>
        <h4>AT&amp;T 70 million record leak</h4>
        <p>A massive breach is surfacing again today. Previously occurring in 2021, the breach comes from an unspecified division of AT&amp;T, and contains records affecting 71 million people. Maybe even me! They claim that its fake, VX-UG claims its real. As always, you decide.</p>

        <h4>McDonalds global outage the result of a config change</h4>
        <p>McDonalds faced an IT outage, blaming a third-party service provider config change for it. The change affected restaurants worldwide. If you email them about it you might get a free burger.</p>

Google has paid out $10 million in bug bounties. The SEC adopted new rules that require public notification within four days of a significant systems compromise. AI is now writing malware and phishing emails. Russian and Chinese cyberespionage groups have been on the move, and the FBI and EUROPOL have knocked out nearly all of the big name ransomware groups. The government is playing a bigger role in our online lives and it is unknown what this will look like going forward.</p>
        <h4>Python packages drain crypto wallets</h4>
        <p>"Threat hunters" (seriously who doesnt want credit for this sort of thing?) have found six Python packages with malicious code in them designed to drain crypto wallets.

        <h4>ALPHV downward spiral</h4>
        <p>Things are still looking rough for ALPHV/BlackCat. They've cut off multiple affiliates from their ransomware access and listed their source code for sale for $5m. It is rumored that they are throwing in the towel. They've since put a fake FBI takedown over their domain.</p>
        <h4>X video calling fucking doxxes you lmao!</h4>
        <p>X released video calling for their X premium subscribers (all 6 of them) last year and have since expanded to all users. Users found that the new feature makes it REALLY easy to troll someone, as well as complaining that it FUCKING DOXXES YOU. The software makes a user relatively easy to physically track using network traffic analysis tools, and also exposes your ip on the feature's help page.
