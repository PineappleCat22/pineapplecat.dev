                <p>This amalgam of technology on top of being my main server (running plex, fail2ban, hosting my webserver, pihole, data storage, vpn server, temporary security camera, etc.) at one point also served to remotely boot up my main tower pc. It's got a relay HAT on it and is duct taped to a 5 port netgear switch and a 2tb usb hard drive that it can barely power. It would boot my pc by switching a relay on with some very simple python code. Nowadays the main pc is with me in college (I never reinstalled the power button).</p>

        <h3>Cybersecurity News</h3>
        <h4>July 29th, 2024</h4>
        <p>im going to include sources now. is that okay?</p>
        <h4>Email routing flaw, millions of phishing emails distributed</h4>
        <p>Proofpoint, a cybersecurity firm that provides email security. In January 2024, an unknown group was able to exploit vulnerable email relays to send millions of fully authenticated very authentic looking phishing emails. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/proofpoint-email-routing-flaw-exploited.html">SOURCE</a></p>
        <h4>3000 goblins want to give your computer covid</h4>
        <p>A threat actor known as "Stargazer Goblin" has created 3000 fake github accounts for the purpose of Malware Distribution as a Service (DaaS?). The network is reported to have been active since August 2022. This "ghost network" of bots operates by putting up fake repositories to try and get you to download malware thinking its something very legitimate, like game hacks. Or something like that. Read the damn article. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/stargazer-goblin-creates-3000-fake.html">SOURCE</a></p>
        <h4>we're back</h4>
        <p>oooookay lets see what i missed. crowdstrike, all major hacker forums fucking collapsed on themselves, and there was also of course all the political shit. HOLY FUCK. daily cybersec news will resume. i cant be bothered to recap all that shit</p>
        <h4>SITE WAS DOWN FROM 4/19/2024 TO 7/28/2024</h4>
        <h4>April 18th, 2024</h4>
        <h4>Akira Ransomware group collects $42 mil</h4>
        <p>Akira Ransomware, a group that appeared last march, has been gaining notoriety targeting victims worldwide. They've thus far claimed over 250 victims and the FBI reports they've made $42 million in ransoms.</p>
        <h4>LabHost Phishing Platform Shut Down</h4>
        <p>LabHost, a platform offering Phishing as a Service since 2021, has now been shut down by international law enforcement. Europol uncovered 40,000 domains linked to LabHost, and killed them all. While they were running they stole 480,000 credit cards, and raked in over a million USD in subscription fees.</p>
        <h4>April 15th, 2024</h4>
        <h4>Change Healthcare Leaks Begin</h4>
        <p>Amidst the chaos of ALPHV collapsing, former affiliate Notchy fled to RansomHub with the Change Healthcare data, and is now attempting to extort them after the ransom was supposedly paid, despite United Healthcare denying it. Previews of the data show accounting data and data sharing agreements.</p>
        <h4>Data Extraction, Google NotebookML</h4>
        <p>Google NotebookML is an online service using a language ai model to analyze data. Researchers found that Google's AI could be poisoned with curated inputs to send data to remote servers, so a malicious user could intentionally submit data that would give them access to confidential information or credentials.</p>
        <h4>April 13th, 2024</h4>
        <h4>Security Engineer jailed for three years for $12.3 million in crypto theft</h4>
        <p>Wait, what? Shakeeb Ahmed, a security engineer now since fired, plead guilty to stealing $12.3 MILLION by hacking two decentralized crypto exchanges in july. He generated fake fees allowing him to take millions. He's done this multiple times, and when he gets caught he returns most (keyword: most) of the money, keeping a small cut as a "bug bounty". $12.3 million and only 3 years? damn.</p>
        <h4>Palo Alto critical security flaw, zero day attacks since March</h4>
        <p>Since March, hackers have been exploiting a flaw only now being disclosed to us in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS. The exploit creates a CRON job to run commands hosted on an external server every minute. Palo Alto is a leading provider of enterprise cybersecurity equipment, so this is a decisive blow to their company.</p>
        <h4>April 11th, 2024</h4>
        <h4>$10 million ransom against Hoya</h4>
        <p>Hoya, a firm that makes optical instruments and medical equipment, has disclosed a cyberattack affecting their production and orders. The group responsible, Hunters International, says they have 2 TB of stolen data, and are asking for $10 million in order to not release them. This could be juicy.</p>
        <h4>Apple warning countries of cyberattacks</h4>
        <p>Apple has reached out to users in more than 150 countries that have been targeted in a wide series of cyberattacks. They've pointed the finger at NSO group, a company that makes "mercenary spyware". Basically lockbit with an LLC</p>
        <h4>Deepfake calls are real and they are coming for you</h4>
        <p>ok maybe not you specifically. LastPass has revealed that hackers have targeted their employees with deepfake phone calls from the CEO. The attack failed, but this shows the capability of AI deepfakes in hacking, and that poorly trained employees may be at risk.</p>
        <h4>April 10th, 2024</h4>
        <p>we're so back</p>
        <h4>First native spectre v2 exploit against linux kernel</h4>
        <p>Researchers have discovered what they call the first native spectre v2 exploit against the linux kernel on intel systems. They call it Native Branch History Injection, and it can leak kernel memory at 3.5kB per second. Its probably intel's fault.</p>
        <h4>AT&T says 51 million compromised in data breach</h4>
        <p>AT&T has a cool new breach, or maybe it was the old one. They are sending notifications to 51 million customers warning them about the breach. They have not disclosed how the data was obtained. Hope i dont get an email.</p>
        <h4>My notes on XZ exploit</h4>
        <p>also while i was gone a major incident happened where someone tried to implement a backdoor in a library which would expose all debian and rpm systems. it was discovered by a microsoft dev who had noticed his ssh was taking 500 ms longer. the malicious party in question had a full plan on hacking the entire internet. its thwarted now, theres nothing to worry about.</p>
        <h4>March 20th, 2024</h4>
        <p>i am very sick</p>
        <h4>Cool new DoS method check it out now!</h4>
        <p>The CISPA Helmholtz-Center for Information Security devised a cool new attack known as "Loop DoS", which works pretty much like you'd expect. It utilizes a vulnerability in the UDP protocol (CVE-2024-2169) making it susceptible to IP spoofing. This allows an attacked to send a single message to start a communication loop, which can cause outages.</p>
        <h4>Data thief, extortionist, pleads guilty</h4>
        <p>Robert Purbeck, a data thief responsible for stealing the data of 132,000 people, and doing some very nasty healthcare data extorion. Recently he plead guilty to attacking 18 different institutions. He will be paying $1 million to victims. But thats like, seven bucks.</p>
        <h4>March 19th, 2024</h4>
        <h4>EPA and White House warn of water system hackers</h4>
        <p>Uniquely, hackers have begun targeting the United States water infrastructure. kinda weird. The EPA and the NSC have established a task force to deal with the threat.</p>
        <h4>FTC employee impersonators</h4>
        <p>The FTC announced in a statement today that scammers are impersonating their employees and taking youur hard earned cash. So yknow dont be scammed.</p>

        <h4>ohhhhh god.</h4>
        <h4>Xitter's GROK AI now open source</h4>
        <p>The previously premium only GROK ai is now open source. Its a python program. Run it and ask it things.</p>
        <h4>CRITICAL: Apex Legends RCE</h4>
        <p>Today a Remote Code Execution attack has been proven real in Apex Legends. The hackers appear to be attempting to interfere with a tournament or something. Either way, RCEs are bad dont play it until its fixed.</p>
        <h4>AT&amp;T 70 million record leak</h4>
        <p>A massive breach is surfacing again today. Previously occurring in 2021, the breach comes from an unspecified division of AT&amp;T, and contains records affecting 71 million people. Maybe even me! They claim that its fake, VX-UG claims its real. As always, you decide.</p>
        <h4>March 15th, 2024</h4>
        <h4>McDonalds global outage the result of a config change</h4>
        <p>McDonalds faced an IT outage, blaming a third-party service provider config change for it. The change affected restaurants worldwide. If you email them about it you might get a free burger.</p>
        <h4>March 13th, 2024</h4>
        <h4>LockBit Affiliate gets 4 years in jain and ordered to pay $860k</h4>
        <p>Mikhail Vasiliev was a russian-canadian cybercriminal and affiliate of LockBit. He was involved in many of LockBit's bigger attacks. Now he's in jail. Womp womp</p>

        <h4>Looking back on 2023: 12 million secrets and $10 million in bug bounties</h4>
        <p>2023 was a big year for cybersecurity. Experts at GitGuardian have reported 12.8 million auth secrets exposed in github repositories over 2023. Google has paid out $10 million in bug bounties. The SEC adopted new rules that require public notification within four days of a significant systems compromise. AI is now writing malware and phishing emails. Russian and Chinese cyberespionage groups have been on the move, and the FBI and EUROPOL have knocked out nearly all of the big name ransomware groups. The government is playing a bigger role in our online lives and it is unknown what this will look like going forward.</p>
        <h4>Python packages drain crypto wallets</h4>
        <p>"Threat hunters" (seriously who doesnt want credit for this sort of thing?) have found six Python packages with malicious code in them designed to drain crypto wallets. These packages are jsBIP39-decrypt, bip39-mnemonic-decrypt, mnemonic_to_address,  erc20-scanner, public-address-generator, hashdecrypt, and hashdecrypts.</p>

        <h4>Microsoft confirms Russian hackers stole source code</h4>

        <h4>Chinese Software Dev Stealing AI Secrets</h4>

        <h4>March 5th, 2024</h4>
        <p>facebook is down but who cares. it might be glorysec, unsure if they are claiming it. whatever</p>
        <h4>Cool new attack chain: now your NTLM hashes are at risk</h4>
        <p>A threat actor classified as TA577 has been discovered using malicious ZIP attachments in phishing emails disguised as email replies to steal NTLM hashes. what a run on sentence. These hashes can be used in future attacks.</p>
        <h4>ALPHV downward spiral</h4>
        <p>Things are still looking rough for ALPHV/BlackCat. They've cut off multiple affiliates from their ransomware access and listed their source code for sale for $5m. It is rumored that they are throwing in the towel. They've since put a fake FBI takedown over their domain.</p>
        <h4>X video calling fucking doxxes you lmao!</h4>
        <p>X released video calling for their X premium subscribers (all 6 of them) last year and have since expanded to all users. Users found that the new feature makes it REALLY easy to troll someone, as well as complaining that it FUCKING DOXXES YOU. The software makes a user relatively easy to physically track using network traffic analysis tools, and also exposes your ip on the feature's help page. There's a privacy feature, and its disabled by default. LOL</p>
        <h4>March 4th, 2024</h4>
        <h4>ALPHV $22m payday</h4>

        <p>American Express has disclosed a breach warning that credit cards and member data may have been stolen. It isn't known when this occurred, nor how many customers are affected.</p>
        <h4>March 3rd, 2024</h4>
        <h4>LockBit is suffering hard</h4>
        <p>LockBit is struggling to keep followers and affiliates happy as it reposts old victims as well as making false claims of paid ransoms. yikes</p>
        <h4>March 2nd, 2024</h4>
        <h4>$10 Million in rewards on Iranian hacker</h4>
