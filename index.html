                    <p>This amalgam of technology on top of being my 
main server (running plex, fail2ban, hosting my webserver, pihole, data 
storage, vpn server, temporary security camera, etc.) at one point also 
served to remotely boot up my main tower pc. It's got a relay HAT on it 
and is duct taped to a 5 port netgear switch and a 2tb usb hard drive 
that it can barely power. It would boot my pc by switching a relay on 
with some very simple python code. Nowadays the main pc is with me in 
college (I never reinstalled the power button).</p>

            <p>The CISPA Helmholtz-Center for Information Security 
devised a cool new attack known as "Loop DoS", which works pretty much 
like you'd expect. It utilizes a vulnerability in the UDP protocol 
(CVE-2024-2169) making it susceptible to IP spoofing. This allows an 
attacked to send a single message to start a communication loop, which 
can cause outages.</p>
            <h4>Data thief, extortionist, pleads guilty</h4>
            <p>Robert Purbeck, a data thief responsible for stealing the
 data of 132,000 people, and doing some very nasty healthcare data

institutions. He will be paying $1 million to victims. But thats like, 
seven bucks.</p>

            <h4>Looking back on 2023: 12 million secrets and $10 million in bug bounties</h4>
            <p>2023 was a big year for cybersecurity. Experts at 
GitGuardian have reported 12.8 million auth secrets exposed in github 
repositories over 2023. Google has paid out $10 million in bug bounties.
 The SEC adopted new rules that require public notification within four 
days of a significant systems compromise. AI is now writing malware and 
phishing emails. Russian and Chinese cyberespionage groups have been on 
the move, and the FBI and EUROPOL have knocked out nearly all of the big
 name ransomware groups. The government is playing a bigger role in our 
online lives and it is unknown what this will look like going forward.</p>
            <h4>Python packages drain crypto wallets</h4>
            <p>"Threat hunters" (seriously who doesnt want credit for 
this sort of thing?) have found six Python packages with malicious code 
in them designed to drain crypto wallets. These packages are 
jsBIP39-decrypt, bip39-mnemonic-decrypt, mnemonic_to_address,  
erc20-scanner, public-address-generator, hashdecrypt, and hashdecrypts.</p>

stealing over 500 files containing intellectual property and ai secrets.
 It is rumored that he planned to use these files in his own china-based
 tech startup.</p>
            <h4>March 5th, 2024</h4>
            <p>facebook is down but who cares. it might be glorysec, unsure if they are claiming it. whatever</p>

            <p>A threat actor classified as TA577 has been discovered 
using malicious ZIP attachments in phishing emails disguised as email

            <h4>ALPHV downward spiral</h4>
            <p>Things are still looking rough for ALPHV/BlackCat. 
They've cut off multiple affiliates from their ransomware access and 
listed their source code for sale for $5m. It is rumored that they are 
throwing in the towel. They've since put a fake FBI takedown over their 
domain.</p>

            <p>X released video calling for their X premium subscribers 
(all 6 of them) last year and have since expanded to all users. Users 
found that the new feature makes it REALLY easy to troll someone, as 
well as complaining that it FUCKING DOXXES YOU. The software makes a 
user relatively easy to physically track using network traffic analysis 
tools, and also exposes your ip on the feature's help page. There's a 
privacy feature, and its disabled by default. LOL</p>
            <h4>March 4th, 2024</h4>
            <h4>ALPHV $22m payday</h4>
            <p>leaked wallet suggests ALPHV got a 22 million payday from
 Change Healthcare - after the individual responsible got supposedly 
scammed out of his cut and excommunicated by ALPHV.</p>
            <h4>Ukraine claims hacking Russian servers</h4>
            <p>Ukraine's Ministry of Defense claims to have breached 
russian servers and stolen confidential data including encryption 
software, russian secret service documents, and more goodies. Slava
