    <p>if you count how many times i use "fuck" ill give you an ice cream</p>
    <h4>notes on why everything is fucked</h4>
    <p>if there is ever any hope to understand why everything is so incredibly fucked we ought to reverse engineer and take stock of the events that got us in this shitshow.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ISSUE #1 arises from a vulnerability issue in the latest netgear RAX50v2 firmware version where it thinks that every attempt to access the web interface is a DoS attack. fuckin genius. proposed fixes are here <a href="https://community.netgear.com/t5/Nighthawk-with-WiFi-6-AX-and/New-RAX41-42-43-50-54-V2-Firmware-Version-1-1-4-28-Released/m-p/2363771/highlight/true#M37956">https://community.netgear.com/t5/Nighthawk-with-WiFi-6-AX-and/New-RAX41-42-43-50-54-V2-Firmware-Version-1-1-4-28-Released/m-p/2363771/highlight/true#M37956</a></li>
        <li>ISSUE #2: starlink's ipv6 management is utterly fucked. the last time i got ipv6 to work temporarily i had no idea why it worked and it only ever worked after i tried everything three times. thus i have no clue why its having a fit now, and i cant even try and fix it.</li>
        <li>ISSUE #3: my secondary server shit the bed a while ago so i have to rely on the (considerably slower) raspberry pi if i want any access to that net. with the ipv6 being in shambles, i have no way of connecting to that network other than a shoddy but robust vnc connection that will expire in like a month. GOD.</li>
        <li>number 4: none of this would be a problem if i werent like 300 miles away</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>the end is never the end is never the end is</h4>
    <p>it is apparent that the pi is no longer adequate to serve the many purposes that it does. theres just not enough disk space. new plan: move the plex server somewhere else, upgrade the pi disk, and reinstall the web server after saving configs n shit. for the plex server: put it on something more resilient, with a better cpu.</p>
    <h4>server update 6/3/2024</h4>
    <p>i forgot why i had docker in the first place so i just fucking killed it. apt couldnt find it so i had to do it the old fashioned way. lazy fuck had its grips on 1.7gb of space. fuck docker. anyway, something is probably broken now, so note to self: find out what. i only ever had it to maintain like six different databases that some random shit required. fuuuuuuck me.</p>
    <h4>5/24/2024</h4>
    <p>another server went and killed itself. HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA im gonna scrap that pile of silicon and turn it into a sentient ai just so i can tell it off for being so damn crappy. DAMN YOU.</p>
